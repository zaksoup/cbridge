#CBridge: C for scripters
This workshop is intended to introduce folks who's primary area of expertise is scripting languages to C its related concepts.

Over the course of this workshop you will learn about:

1. Compiling and linking
2. Pointers and pointer arithmatic

##Compiling and linking
Unlike interpreted languages like Python and Ruby, C must first be compiled by a compiler before it can be run. This process happens in three steps: preprocessing, compiling, and linking. After your code has been compiled into an executable (on *NIX systems this will be a file with any extension, but commonly is a file with no extension at all. On Windows this is a file with a .exe extension) you will then be able to run your code. Some software, like Coderunner, allow you to write C and C++ and run them and get console output while obscuring the steps of compilation for you. This is very handy for small projects and rapid prototyping but today we're going to focus on how to compile by hand.
